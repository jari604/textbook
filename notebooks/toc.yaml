        This course contains around eight hours of content, and is aimed at
        self-learners who are comfortable with undergraduate-level mathematics
        and quantum computing fundamentals. This course will take you through
        key concepts in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum
        circuits, training these circuits, and applying them to basic problems.
        By the end of the course, you'll understand the state of the field, and
        you'll be familiar with recent developments in both supervised and
        unsupervised learning such as quantum kernels and general adversarial
        networks. This course finishes with a project that you can use to
        showcase what you've learnt.

        This course was created by IBM Quantum with the help of Qiskit Advocates
        through the Qiskit Advocate Mentoring Program.
